In this page, settings of recommendation models will be discussed.

There are typically two kinds of available feedbacks from users: **explicit feedback** and **implicit feedback**.

Explicit Feedback
=================

**For explicit feedback, users give their preferences by ratings**. For example, a user gives 5 stars to a movie he likes and 1 star to a movie that he dislikes. A user's taste could be represented by ratings that he gives.

Implicit Feedback
=================

**For implicit feedback, only positive feedbacks are collected.** For example, implicit feedback represents that a user watched a movie. However, there is no feedback that represents a user dislikes a movie. It's even worse that implicit feedback couldn't show that the user likes the movie. Implicit feedbacks are naturally noisy but it is the most situations in practice.

Weighted Implicit Feedback
